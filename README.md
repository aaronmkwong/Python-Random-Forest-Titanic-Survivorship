# Python-Random-Forest-Titanic-Survivorship

This project uses Random Forest to classify a passenger's survivorship as died or survived. It uses the same engineered data and features as the  **[Logistic Regression Titanic Survivorship](https://github.com/aaronmkwong/Python-Logistic-Regression-Titanic-Survivorship)** project. The custom function rf_mod_assess() returns a dataframe of all of the classifcation report results for each of the 25 trials using Monte Carlo cross validation. 

See also the **[KNN Titanic Survivorship](https://github.com/aaronmkwong/Python-KNN-Titanic-Survivorship)** project.

**_Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression and KNN by 2% and 1% respectively_**.
