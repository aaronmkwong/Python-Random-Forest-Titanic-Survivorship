# Python-Random-Forest-Titanic-Survivorship

**_REPOSITORY UNDER CONSTRUCTION_**

This project uses Random Forest to classify a passenger's survivorship as died or survived. It uses the same engineered data and features as the  **[Logistic Regression Titanic Survivorship](https://github.com/aaronmkwong/Python-Logistic-Regression-Titanic-Survivorship)** project. The custom function rf_mod_assess() returns a dataframe of all of the classifcation report results for each of the 25 trials using Monte Carlo cross validation. 

See also the **[KNN Titanic Survivorship](https://github.com/aaronmkwong/Python-KNN-Titanic-Survivorship)** project.

The code can be viewed here: **[Titanic_Survivorship_Random_Forest_02.ipynb](https://github.com/aaronmkwong/Python-Random-Forest-Titanic-Survivorship/blob/main/Program%20Files/Titanic_Survivorship_Random_Forest_02.ipynb)**.  

**_Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression and KNN by 2% and 1% respectively_**.
